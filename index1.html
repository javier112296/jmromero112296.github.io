<p>This one of my dream cars. It is a classic muscle car.Engine options for 1974 also were exactly the same as they had been the previous year. Base models came with a 350 CID small-block V8 rated at 190 horsepower, and a modified version of this engine could be included as an option and was rated at 250 horsepower. It can go to 0 to 60 in 8.9 seconds </p>

<p>After the Sting Ray Corvettes were introduced in 1963 as the second generation of Americaâ€™s first true sports car, Chevy realized what a great automobile it had built and wisely opted not to make significant changes.</p>
